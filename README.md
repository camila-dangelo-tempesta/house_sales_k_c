## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

House Rocket is a real estate company engaged in the purchase and sale of real estate.

Its main premise is the purchase of properties below the market price, with the potential for remodeling, to resell them at prices compatible with the market. In this way, the company's profit comes from the difference between the purchase and resale price.

Its main objective is to obtain the best properties to obtain the best deals for the highest possible profitability.

 ### 1.1 **Context:**
 
 * Thus, the two partners hired a Data Science consultancy to answer the following questions:
      * Questions:
           * **1. What properties should House Rocket Company buy?**
           * **2. Once these properties are acquired, at what price should they be resold?**

## 3. SOLUTION PLANNING

As a data scientist, I believe in the CRISP-DS methodology for project resolution and rapid value delivery. My project followed the following steps based on this methodology:

- [x] **Step 01:** **Data Description**:  My goal is to use statistics metrics to identify data outside the scope of business.
  - Data Dimension
  - Data types
  - Check NA
  - Fillout NA
  - Change Types
  - Descriptive Statistivas
    * Numerical Attributes
    * Categorical Attributes

- [x] **Step 02:** **Feature Engineering**: Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled.
  - Hypoteses Mindmap
  - Missing values
  - Outlier manipulation
  - Binning
  - One-hot encoding
  - Grouping

- [x] **Step 03:** **Data Filtering**: Filter rows and select columns that do not contain information for modeling or that do not match the scope of the business
  - Line filtering
  - Selection of columns

- [x] **Step 04:** Exploratory Data Analysis:Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning. - Line filtering
  - Univariate Analysis
  - Bivariate Analysis
  - Multivariate analysis
